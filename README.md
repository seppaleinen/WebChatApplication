# WebChatApplication
A webchat using NodeJS and SocketIO and Giphy.

Project created on a mac.<br>
1: Node is required, so install that if you dont have it. I used v8.4.0 while developing.<br>
2: Go to the source folder with the terminal and start the Node server by typing "node server" inside the terminal.<br>
3: Go to localhost:3000 in your browser to access the page.<br>

You can now open the page on mutiply different tabs and chat with yourself as well as send gifs.
